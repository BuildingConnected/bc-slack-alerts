# bc-slack-alerts
App deployed to Heroku's free tier to pass alerts from a few of our team's various services to our slack channel.

Uses the various service's webhooks to send data and format it to be used by another project of mine called slack-bot in order to post bot messages in our slack channel about important events. Also supports outgoing webhooks from slack so you can type /heroku and get heroku's current status as a bot message in slack.
